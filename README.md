# Brain Tumor Prediction

## Overview
Brain Tumor Prediction is a machine learning project designed to detect brain tumors from MRI images. This project features a web application that allows users to upload MRI scans and receive predictions regarding the presence of brain tumors.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Streamlit** (for the web application)
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (for model building)
- **OpenCV** (for image processing)


## Dataset
The dataset comprises MRI images labeled with the presence or absence of brain tumors. It has been sourced from [Kaggle/Other Source].

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sanath-tejas-474/Brain_tumor_prediction.git
    cd Brain_tumor_prediction
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## Usage
1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
2. Upload an MRI scan image using the provided interface.
3. Click on the 'Predict' button to get the prediction results.
